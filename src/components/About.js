            <h3>Moesha Aurelle Emaleu Deutou | Software Engineering Technician student | Web & Data enthusiast</h3>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m a Software Engineering Technician student at Centennial College with hands-on experience in logistics, software engineering, and web development. I have a strong 
              interest in React, databases, and data analytics, and Iâ€™m building a professional portfolio that combines software engineering, data science, and cloud technologies. Previously, 
              I worked as a logistics assistant, gaining 1 year+ of experience in planning, inventory, and operations management.
            </p>
            <p>
              My approach combines a strong foundation in software engineering principles with creative problem-solving to design practical, user-focused solutions. Iâ€™m passionate
              about clean and maintainable code, responsive design, and building projects that bridge both software development and data analysis. As I continue my studies in Software
              Engineering at Centennial College, I stay committed to learning emerging technologies in web development, data science, and cloud computing, while applying them to real-world
              projects that prepare me for a career in the tech industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of coding and class projects, I build my portfolio, work on web and data projects, and explore new tools in AI, cloud, and data science to prepare for a career in software engineering and data analytics.
            </p>
