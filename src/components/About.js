            <h3>Moesha Aurelle Emaleu Deutou Software Engineering Technician student â€¢ Web & Data enthusiast</h3>
            <p>
            Hello! Iâ€™m Moesha Aurelle Emaleu Deutou, a Software Engineering Technician student at Centennial College with hands-on experience in logistics,
            software engineering, and web development. I have a strong interest in React, databases, and data analytics, and Iâ€™m currently building a 
            professional portfolio that combines software engineering, data science, and cloud technologies. In the past, I worked as a logistics assistant 
            in my home country, where I gained 2 years of practical experience in planning, inventory, and operations management. My goal is to grow as a 
            data-driven software engineer, contribute to impactful projects, and pursue opportunities in web development, data analytics, and cloud computing after graduation
            </p>
            <p>
             My approach combines a strong foundation in software engineering principles with creative problem-solving to design practical, user-focused solutions. Iâ€™m passionate
             about clean and maintainable code, responsive design, and building projects that bridge both software development and data analysis. As I continue my studies in Software
             Engineering at Centennial College, I stay committed to learning emerging technologies in web development, data science, and cloud computing, while applying them to real-world
             projects that prepare me for a career in the tech industry.
            </p>
            <p>
             When Iâ€™m not coding or working on class projects, I spend time building my portfolio, practicing web and data projects, and learning new tools in AI, cloud, and data science. 
             I also enjoy taking online courses and connecting with tech communities as I prepare for a career in software engineering and data analytics
